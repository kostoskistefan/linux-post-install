# Linux Post Installation Script [![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0-red.svg)](https://semver.org)

This script is just a minimal personal preference on software that I use on every Linux distribution. Automatically installs and configures it to my preference. Feel free to change it.

Currently it includes the following software:

* Oh My Zsh
* Neovim
* Tmux
* NodeJS
* Node Package Manager (NPM)
* Google Chrome
* Visual Studio Code
* Conky
* Powerline Fonts
* Poiret One Font
* GNOME Startup Settings

## Requirements
* Advanced Package Tool (APT)
* curl

## Usage
Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/kostoskistefan/linux-post-install.git`

Change to the cloned directory: `cd linux-post-install`

Run the script: `sudo ./install.sh`
